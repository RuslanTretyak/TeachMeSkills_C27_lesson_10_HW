Homework for the tenth lesson

**task1** This is a program from HW7 witch was improve by using modifier "Sealed" to class GeometricFigure.

This program displays a message on the screen indicating how many identical cards the client has. The "Client" class has 
the fields "name", "surname", and an array of objects of the "Card" class. This class "Client" also has a method 
"calculateSameCards()" and an overridden method "toString()". The "calculateSameCards()" method counts the number of 
identical elements of the array "cards". The overridden method "toString()" displays information about the client's first 
and last name, as well as the number of identical cards. The "Card" class has three fields - "cvv", "cardNumber" and 
"currentAmount" on the card, as well as two overridden methods - "equals()" and "hashCode()". The "equals()" and 
"hashCode()" methods do not use a field "currentAmount".
